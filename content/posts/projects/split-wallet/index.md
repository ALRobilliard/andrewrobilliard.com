Manage your money, easily share expenses with others, take control.

Split is a web application that seeks to make financial and transactional management simple and easy. The main target audience is people who need to "split" multiple transaction in their day to day lives - couples, or flatmates groups of friends.

The first part of the project - the API - is currently under-development and is nearing the release of version 1. The API interacts with a PostgreSQL database for holding transactional and user data.

## Next Steps

Once version 1 of the Split API has been released (likely deployed to Heroku), then work on the client will begin. The current plan is to build a PWA with React, producing a client that is available across all types of devices.
